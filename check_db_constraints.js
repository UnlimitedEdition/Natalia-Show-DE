To check database constraints, you would typically run these SQL queries:

1. Check constraints on content table:
   SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type 
   FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
   WHERE table_name = 'content';

2. Check unique constraints specifically:
   SELECT constraint_name, column_name
   FROM information_schema.constraint_column_usage
   WHERE table_name = 'content'
   AND constraint_name IN (
     SELECT constraint_name 
     FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
     WHERE table_name = 'content' 
     AND constraint_type = 'UNIQUE'
   );

3. Check primary key:
   SELECT a.attname
   FROM pg_index i
   JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attrelid = i.indrelid AND a.attnum = ANY(i.indkey)
   WHERE i.indrelid = 'content'::regclass AND i.indisprimary;
`);
